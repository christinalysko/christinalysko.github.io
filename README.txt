This portfolio site has evolved from multiple pages 
of html and css into my current collection. It was 
very difficult to learn the new languages and use them
correctly throughout this semester, but I am surprised
to be proud of what I had accomplished. I can see so
many things I would like to add to my website in the
future and look forward to making these changes when
I have the spare time. This site will be very beneficial
to me as a designer. 

In my site I was very excited to code the modal. It sits
well on the page when opened, displays a breif title of
my works, and closes when the esc key or "X" button are input.
The Nav bar is located at the bottom of the screen to the right.
On hover of the portfolio pieces, they become full color. If 
the window is larger than 1400 pixels wide, a description will
appear in the margins. Ive also added a custom cursor on hover,
and my site follows a strict color scheme defined in the code.
Some browsers will support my custom scroll bar on the right.
My site contains three pages of HTML, and a contact button.
The Portfolio page, the About Me Page and my Resume. When contact is
opened, I have defined a subject for the user to auto-fill
when the mail app opens. This is so I know that they were 
directed from my website.
